              <p>KWS is one of the world’s leading plant breeding companies. Over 5,000 employees in more than 70 countries generated net sales of around €1.5 billion in the fiscal year 2021/2022. A company with a tradition of family ownership, KWS has operated independently for 165 years. It focuses on plant breeding and the production and sale of seed for corn, sugarbeet, cereals, vegetables, oilseed rape and sunflower. KWS uses leading-edge plant breeding methods to continuously improve yield for farmers and plants’ resistance to diseases, pests and abiotic stress. To that end, the company invested more than €285 million last fiscal year in research and development. </p>

              <p>We've got farming down to a science. By fast-forwarding natural breeding techniques, we develop improved varieties of tropical crops that are easier to cultivate and healthier for people and the planet. So growers can keep growing and we can all enjoy more of the food we love. As the population grows, we need a way to feed it. So, we’re starting with tropical staples to nourish those living in these expanding regions and to provide the food and drink loved by everyone around the world. But, this isn’t just about the consumer. Our technology is opening up a new way of working. One that connects the dots between production and consumption and gives growers the tools to meet the environmental pressures of today.</p>

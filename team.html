              <p>Isobel is a PhD student in Leonie Luginbuehl's lab. She works on understanding how plants regulate carbon allocation to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, using techniques like single cell sequencing and radiolabelled carbon tracing. Outside of the lab she loves hanging out with friends, working at her college bar, travelling, running, and reading.</p>
              <p>As the chair of the NoCaSS committee, Isobel coordinates the work of the team. Her goal is to make NoCaSS an encouraging and supportive environment where people feel comfortable discussing their research and making new friends.

His research focuses on the colonisation dynamics of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, aiming to unravel the various ways in which agrochemicals affect these interactions. Through his PhD and future career, he hopes to bridge fundamental biology with sustainable agricultural practices around soil microbiomes.In his free time, Nick enjoys writing and casual gaming.</p>
              <p>As the treasurer for NoCaSS 2025, he has firmly ruled out bouncy castles but otherwise manages a generous budget made possible by our sponsors to ensure a great symposium. He looks forward to fostering insightful discussions, connecting with fellow researchers, and helping to create an engaging conference experience for other early-career scientists.</p>

She spends half of her time in the Department of Plant Sciences at Cambridge, studying the circadian influence on calcium signaling in Arabidopsis, an important subject to understand how plant respond to stress depending on the environment and time of day.On the side she’s an active member of political and environmental societies. Charlotte enjoys nature, sports, food, being outdoors, and spending time with friends and family. </p>
              <p>Charlotte is thrilled to help bring together this event, which she truly enjoyed attending last year. She looks forward to gather passionate young researchers in this special space for career development and introduce them to the lovely town of Cambridge, which has become a second home for her.</p>
